# Render Deployment Fixes

## Issue 1: Migration Error ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:** Migration 0006 tried to add `season` column that already existed in production DB.

**Solution:** Rewrote migration 0006 to safely check if columns exist before adding them.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Migration file updated - will deploy successfully now.

## Issue 2: Email Reminders Not Working

### Root Cause Analysis

Your email reminders aren't working because **Celery workers and Celery Beat aren't running on Render**.

### Current Setup (Not Working):
- ‚úÖ Celery is installed (`celery==5.4.0`)
- ‚úÖ Redis is configured (`CELERY_BROKER_URL`)
- ‚úÖ django-celery-beat is installed
- ‚úÖ Tasks are defined in `poolapp/tasks.py`
- ‚úÖ Signals schedule tasks in `poolapp/signals.py`
- ‚ùå **No Celery worker process running**
- ‚ùå **No Celery Beat scheduler running**

### What Needs to Happen:

On Render, you need **3 separate services**:
1. **Web Service** - Your Django app (already running ‚úÖ)
2. **Worker Service** - Celery worker to execute tasks (MISSING ‚ùå)
3. **Beat Service** - Celery Beat scheduler to trigger tasks on schedule (MISSING ‚ùå)

---

## Solution: Add Celery Workers on Render

### Step 1: Verify Redis is Running

In your Render dashboard, check if you have a Redis instance. If not:
1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click "New +" ‚Üí "Redis"
3. Create a Redis instance
4. Copy the **Internal Redis URL**
5. Add to environment variable: `CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://...`

### Step 2: Create Celery Worker Service

In Render Dashboard:

1. **Click "New +" ‚Üí "Background Worker"**
2. **Configure:**
   - Name: `survivor-pool-celery-worker`
   - Environment: `Python 3`
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start Command: `celery -A survivor_pool worker --loglevel=info`
   - Instance Type: `Starter` (free tier OK)

3. **Add Environment Variables** (same as web service):
   ```
   DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=survivor_pool.settings
   SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
   DATABASE_URL=<your-postgres-url>
   CELERY_BROKER_URL=<your-redis-url>
   EMAIL_HOST=<your-smtp-host>
   EMAIL_PORT=<your-smtp-port>
   EMAIL_HOST_USER=<your-email>
   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=<your-password>
   DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=<your-from-email>
   ```

### Step 3: Create Celery Beat Service

In Render Dashboard:

1. **Click "New +" ‚Üí "Background Worker"**
2. **Configure:**
   - Name: `survivor-pool-celery-beat`
   - Environment: `Python 3`
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start Command: `celery -A survivor_pool beat --loglevel=info --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler`
   - Instance Type: `Starter` (free tier OK)

3. **Add Environment Variables** (same as web service and worker)

---

## Alternative: Single Procfile Approach (If Render Supports)

If you're on a platform that uses Procfile (like Heroku), create this file:

**Procfile:**
```
web: gunicorn survivor_pool.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
worker: celery -A survivor_pool worker --loglevel=info
beat: celery -A survivor_pool beat --loglevel=info --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler
```

But **Render doesn't use Procfile** - you need separate services.

---

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check if Worker is Running

In Render Dashboard ‚Üí Celery Worker Logs, you should see:
```
[2025-10-13 12:00:00,000: INFO/MainProcess] Connected to redis://...
[2025-10-13 12:00:00,000: INFO/MainProcess] celery@worker ready.
```

### 2. Check if Beat is Running

In Render Dashboard ‚Üí Celery Beat Logs, you should see:
```
[2025-10-13 12:00:00,000: INFO/MainProcess] beat: Starting...
[2025-10-13 12:00:00,000: INFO/MainProcess] Scheduler: django_celery_beat.schedulers.DatabaseScheduler
```

### 3. Test Email Task Manually

SSH into your Render shell or use Django admin:
```python
from poolapp.tasks import send_reminder_emails_for_week
result = send_reminder_emails_for_week.delay(week_id=1, debug=True)
```

You should see email sending in worker logs.

### 4. Check Scheduled Tasks

In Django Admin ‚Üí Periodic Tasks, you should see:
- Tasks created by `poolapp/signals.py` (line 98-125)
- Each week should have a scheduled reminder 2 hours before lock time

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Connection refused" error in worker logs
**Fix:** Redis URL is wrong. Check `CELERY_BROKER_URL` environment variable.

### Issue: Worker starts but can't import Django
**Fix:** Add `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=survivor_pool.settings` to worker environment variables.

### Issue: Beat runs but tasks don't execute
**Fix:** Worker isn't running. Both beat AND worker must be running simultaneously.

### Issue: Tasks execute but emails don't send
**Fix:** Check email environment variables:
```
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-app-password  # NOT your regular password!
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
```

**For Gmail:** You need an "App Password", not your regular password:
1. Go to Google Account ‚Üí Security
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
3. Create App Password for "Mail"
4. Use that 16-character password as `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`

## Cost Estimate

On Render:
- **Web Service:** $0-7/month (Starter)
- **Celery Worker:** $0-7/month (Starter)
- **Celery Beat:** $0-7/month (Starter)
- **Redis:** $0 (free 25 MB) or $10/month (1 GB)

**Total:** Free tier should work fine for small leagues!

## Testing Checklist

After deploying all three services:

- [ ] Web service is running (main app loads)
- [ ] Redis is connected (check in Render dashboard)
- [ ] Celery Worker logs show "celery@worker ready"
- [ ] Celery Beat logs show "beat: Starting..."
- [ ] Django Admin ‚Üí Periodic Tasks shows scheduled reminders
- [ ] Test email task manually (check worker logs for success)
- [ ] Wait for scheduled time and check if email arrives

## Quick Debug: Is Celery Even Needed?

**Alternative Option:** If you don't want to run 3 services, you can **disable Celery** and use a simpler cron-based approach:

1. **Remove Celery completely**
2. **Use Render's Cron Jobs** feature
3. **Create a management command** to send emails
4. **Schedule it to run every hour**

This is simpler but less flexible. Let me know if you want this approach instead!

## Summary

**To fix email reminders:**
1. ‚úÖ Migration 0006 is fixed (deploy will work)
2. ‚ùå Create Celery Worker service on Render
3. ‚ùå Create Celery Beat service on Render
4. ‚ùå Verify Redis connection
5. ‚ùå Add all environment variables to both services
6. ‚ùå Deploy and check logs

**Once these 3 services are running, emails will work automatically!** üìß

Let me know if you want help with any specific step or if you'd prefer the simpler cron-based approach instead.
